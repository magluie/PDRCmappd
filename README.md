 This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. In the project directory, you can run:
 npm start
 Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
 The page will reload if you make edits, you will also see some alerts in the console.
 I have double checked everything before compressing and it should be fine.
 If you cannot start the project, please run:
 npm install
 To ensure that no dependencies are lost. 
 Or you can directly naviage to this link: (I have depolyed the final version on 000webhostapp)
